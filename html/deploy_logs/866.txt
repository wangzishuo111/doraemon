ERROR! Syntax Error while loading YAML.
  found unacceptable key (unhashable type: 'AnsibleMapping')

The error appears to have been in '/home/op/Java_service_release/Java_service_release.yml': line 5, column 6, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

  roles:
  - {{ service_name }}
     ^ here
We could be wrong, but this one looks like it might be an issue with
missing quotes.  Always quote template expression brackets when they
start a value. For instance:

    with_items:
      - {{ foo }}

Should be written as:

    with_items:
      - "{{ foo }}"
